    # or pnpm install
    ```

### Running the Application

*   `✨` **Start the Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`. The application will automatically reload upon code changes.

*   `📦` **Build for Production**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles the project for production, generating optimized static assets in the `dist` folder.

*   `🚀` **Preview the Production Build**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    After building, you can use this command to serve the production build locally, allowing you to test it before deployment.

## Usage

Interacting with the "My Daily Tasks" application is straightforward and intuitive.

*   **Adding a Task**: To add a new task, simply type its description into the input field labeled "Add a new task..." and click the `+` icon next to it. The task will appear at the bottom of your list.

*   **Marking as Complete**: Each task has a circular icon on its left. Click this icon to toggle the task's completion status. A green checkmark indicates a completed task, which will also be styled with a strikethrough and grayed-out text.

*   **Editing a Task**: To modify the text of an existing task, click the `📝` (pen) icon associated with that task. A prompt will appear, allowing you to enter a new description for the task.

*   **Deleting a Task**: If you wish to remove a task, click the `🗑️` (delete left) icon next to it. The task will be instantly removed from your list.

All your changes (adding, editing, deleting, and completing tasks) are automatically saved to your browser's Local Storage, ensuring your to-do list persists across sessions.
